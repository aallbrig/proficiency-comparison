                    <h5>What This Measures</h5>
                    <p><strong>Basic literacy:</strong> The percentage of adults (age 15+) who can read and write at a basic level - meaning they can understand simple written instructions, read a newspaper headline, or write their name and a simple note.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
                    <p>Literacy is the foundation of all education and civic participation. In 1870, one in five Americans couldn't read - often due to lack of schools, especially in rural areas and for formerly enslaved populations. By 1980, basic literacy became nearly universal (99%) thanks to compulsory education laws and public school expansion.</p>
                    
                    <div class="alert alert-info mb-3">
                        <strong>Historical Context:</strong> The dramatic rise from 80% (1870) to 99% (1980) represents one of America's greatest educational achievements. Post-Civil War education reforms, Progressive Era school expansion, and New Deal programs all contributed to this transformation.

                    <p><strong>Bachelor's degree attainment:</strong> The percentage of adults age 25 and older who have completed at least a four-year college degree (bachelor's, master's, doctoral, or professional degree).</p>

                    <p>Higher education levels correlate with higher lifetime earnings, better health outcomes, and increased civic engagement. This metric shows the transformation of college from an elite privilege (4.6% in 1940) to a common credential (33%+ today). It reflects changing job market demands, GI Bill impacts, and expanding access to higher education.</p>

                    <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
                    <p>High school graduation is the gateway to economic opportunity and higher education. A high school diploma is now essential for most jobs, but in 1870, only 2% graduated - high school was for the elite. The rise to 87% represents the democratization of secondary education through compulsory attendance laws, child labor restrictions, and the shift from an agricultural to industrial economy.</p>

The rise to 94.5% represents compulsory education laws (1852-1918), child labor restrictions, and the social transformation that made childhood about learning, not earning.</p>

                    <h5>What This Measures</h5>
                    <p><strong>Kindergarten entry scores:</strong> Average reading and mathematics assessment scores (0-100 scale) for children entering kindergarten in the fall, based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) cohort assessments.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
                    <p>Early childhood readiness predicts later academic success. These scores show what children know when they start formal schooling - reflecting the quality of pre-K programs, parental education, and early learning environments. Children who start kindergarten behind often stay behind without intervention.</p>

                            <li><strong>Baseline (1998):</strong> Reading: 38, Math: 36 - established with ECLS-K cohort</li>
                            <li><strong>Improvement trend:</strong> Gradual gains through 2019 as pre-K expands</li>
                            <li><strong>COVID-19 impact (2020-2021):</strong> Sharp drop in scores due to preschool closures and isolation</li>
                            <li><strong>Recovery (2022):</strong> Scores rebounding but not yet back to 2019 levels</li>
                            <li><strong>Context:</strong> A 5-point gain represents roughly 6 months of learning</li>
